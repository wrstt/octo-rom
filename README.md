# UMIDIGI C2 Android 13 Stock Rom/Built-OEMISH(oem-ish) so I guesssss-Custom Build but (not really) unless octo-roms-trying out again📱

**Status: Updated as of September 2, 2023 | Build Date: May 9, 2023, by ***THIS PERSON on ******THIS WEBSITE** 🔄

This repository contains a custom Android 13 build for the UMIDIGI C2 smartphone. It is a ported version of Google Pixel 4, 4a, 5, and 5a T1BA Google A13 Builds, tailored to match the MediaTek MT6761 chipset. Please note that this is a community-driven project, and the build is not originally mine but has been adapted for UMIDIGI C2. 🤝

**Important:** In the device settings, it may show MT8781 instead of MT6761. This is a common issue that spans multiple MEDIATEK chipsets. 🚨

## Purpose 🎯

The purpose of this project is to foster future development and experimentation on the UMIDIGI C2 device. It provides a foundation for custom ROM development and device tweaking. 🛠️
